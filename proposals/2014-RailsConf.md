### Abstract

Are you from a non-C.S. background? What about someone you mentor?
Many junior devs’ top focus is building technical knowledge.
However, they already have other skills that can help them in their
roles immediately! Some of these include helping their team focus on
the right tasks and working well with stakeholders like PM and
support. This talk will discuss the non-technical contributions
junior devs can make now and how their senior dev mentors can help
them ramp up more quickly as a result.


### Details

The goal for this talk is to prompt junior devs to consider all the ways
in which they can contribute to the success of their team despite being
new to programming. Many of the skills people have developed in other
careers do still transfer into software development and can be incredibly
beneficial to their team precisely because they are different from those
developed in a more “traditional” path into tech. Some of the points I’d
like to make:
* building good relationships with your own team and cross-functionally
(especially with your tech support folks) will make everyone more inclined
to help you learn
* good questions are the junior dev’s superpower--they can help your team
move faster by highlighting assumptions they’re making and not waste time
on tangents
* providing constructive feedback, to the right person in the right venue
at the right time is hard for a lot of people, this is a skill that you
probably have already practiced
* if you can articulate clearly what you don’t understand and when you
need help, it will be easier for people to help you
* there is too much for a junior dev to learn, I think you’re better
served by focusing on company-specific stuff, like the process for using
Git or product knowledge, as opposed to an area like keyboard shortcuts,
for now (keyboard shortcuts are probably not the limiting factor on job
productivity here)
* you can give a more favorable impression to your manager by doing things
like writing good project status updates (and submitting them on time) and
giving great demos of your teams’ work to stakeholders


### Pitch
The tech industry has been unable to find enough experienced, traditionally-
qualified candidates for all the jobs that are available, so there are more
and more developers learning the craft on-the-job. The natural tendency is
to solely focus on the core competency, i.e. coding. However, those new to
the industry already possess other useful skills and can adapt them for
software development quickly. This will help them gain confidence that they
belong and deal with imposter syndrome, but of course also benefits their
teams and employers and speeds up their career development.

It was only a little over a year ago that I began to consider this career
a viable option for me, and I was very much concerned about having to entirely
start over in a new field. Fortunately, I’ve instead found that my past
experience was not wasted time at all, but instead something I can still draw
upon to help compensate for my lack of technical experience. Others can do
the same!


### Bio

I studied Biology in college and was all set to attend medical school and
fulfill my mother’s dream of my becoming a doctor. Instead, I got a job at
Google in tech support. After five years at Google, I took a sabbatical to
attend Hackbright Academy. Now I’m a junior developer at New Relic.
